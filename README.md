# Godot RL Pathfinder Demo

This project is a demonstration of a Reinforcement Learning (RL) pathfinding agent built in Godot Engine, inspired by and utilizing resources from [edbeeching/godot_rl_agents](https://github.com/edbeeching/godot_rl_agents).

## Overview

- **Engine:** Godot
- **RL Framework:** godot_rl_agents
- **Purpose:** Showcase a trained agent navigating a pathfinding environment using RL techniques.

## Training

- Training scripts and configuration are based on the original [godot_rl_agents](https://github.com/edbeeching/godot_rl_agents) repo.
- You can retrain agents or use the provided models for inference.

## Credits

- RL framework and core logic adapted from [edbeeching/godot_rl_agents](https://github.com/edbeeching/godot_rl_agents)
- Additional modifications and demo by [Your Name]
